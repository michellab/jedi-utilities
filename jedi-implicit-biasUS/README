This example executes a setup of a jedi calculation using a ligand to position the grid.
This is followed by an implicit solvent setup.
The protein is then minimized. 
The protein is then equilibrated with positional restraints for 2 ps.
A production run of 2 ps then performed. 
The JEDI collective variable, grid coordinates and derivatives are saved in output files
 every 100 steps. 
The SITE keyword option was used to deactivate grid points that are far away from the SITE pdb file.
The MD simulation is biased at every step using a harmonic restraining potential.
