This example describes how to setup input files for a JEDI calculation. 
Here we use as input an all-atom model of the protein structure of interest.

We also have as input a file that describes a rectangular cuboid. 
The cuboid is used to select protein polar and apolar atoms that will be used for
JEDI calculations. 

The example is run by typing

bash RUNME.sh

This will generate three output files, apolar.pdb, polar.pdb and grid.pdb.

This output can be compared to reference files that are in the folder reference output.
