This example executes a setup of a jedi calculation using a ligand to position the grid.
This is followed by an explicit solvent setup.
The protein is then minimized. 
The protein is then equilibrated with positional restraints for 2 ps (NVT).
This is followed by a 2 ps NPT equilibration with positional restraints.
A production run of 2 ps then performed. 
The JEDI collective variable, grid coordinates and derivatives are computed every 100 steps. 
The SITE keyword option was used to deactivate grid points that are far away from the SITE pdb file.
Biasing is applied at every step of the MD simulation using a harmonic potential
Flags are passed to run GROMACS fast on a GPU and multiple cores.
