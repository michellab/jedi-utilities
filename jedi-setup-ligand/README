This example describes how to setup input files for a JEDI calculation. 
Here we use as input an all-atom model of the protein structure of interest.
We also have as input the coordinates of a ligand, and we wish to define a grid 
region that covers the space occupied by the ligand. 

The example is run by typing

bash RUNME.sh

This will generate three output files, apolar.pdb, polar.pdb and grid.pdb.

This output can be compared to reference files that are in the folder reference output.
